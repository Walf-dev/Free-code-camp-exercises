            Kobe Bean Bryant was an American professional basketball player. A shooting guard, Bryant entered the National Basketball Association (NBA) directly from high school, and played his entire 20-season professional career in the league with the Los Angeles Lakers. <br><br><br>

              <li class="about1">Born in August 23, 1978</li> <br>
              Bryant was born in Philadelphia, the youngest of three children and only son of former NBA player Joe Bryant and Pamela Cox Bryant. 
              He was also the maternal nephew of basketball player John "Chubby" Cox. 
              His parents named him after the famous beef of Kobe, Japan, which they saw on a restaurant menu.</div><br><br>
              <div class="d2">
              <li class="about2">High school</li><br>
              Bryant earned national recognition during a spectacular high school career at Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, located in the Philadelphia suburb of Lower Merion. 
              He played on the varsity basketball team as a freshman.</div><br><br>

              On January 26, 2020, in a Sikorsky S-76 helicopter departed from John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California, with nine people aboard: Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna, six family friends and the pilot.</div>

                The tributes to Bryant rolled in from around the country on Sunday after the news broke that he had been killed in a helicopter crash along with his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, and seven other people.

                But the shock of Bryant’s death at 41 hit particularly hard in Southern California, where people across geographic, economic and cultural divides were united for the day — in grief. <br><br>
                Although Bryant was a global celebrity who transformed the N.B.A., fans said he always felt like a true local.

                “Kobe was our king,” John Epiceno, 63, told me as he gazed at Echo Park Lake, the swan boats gliding past. “He stood for L.A.”

                Mr. Epiceno showed me a Dodgers tattoo on one forearm, and a tattoo that read “Rams” on the other. On his back, he said, was his Lakers ink. <br><br>
                A lifelong Angeleno, Mr. Epiceno said he admired Bryant’s efforts to help the poor in Los Angeles and to work in struggling communities.

                But he said he also looked forward to Bryant adding to his basketball legacy: He had hoped Bryant would someday return to the Lakers as coach. <br><br>
